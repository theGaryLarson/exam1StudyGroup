Study Group Base Examples to be used during our study group

### Warning!
Even though the examples are broken into tests.
These are not what tests would look like.
Tests would contain assert statements and be broken into smaller chunks with meaningful names for each test

I thought this was a good way to organize without polluting examples with unnecessary code.
